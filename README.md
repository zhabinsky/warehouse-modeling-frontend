A simple demo app that let's you configure the layout of warehouse shelves.
Potentially can be used to build a digital twin of your warehouse with navigation, storage history etc.

## Disclaimer

I was just prototyping, therefore if you ever use this code:

- Double-check how build works, it just ignores a lot of type errors caused by mui+r3f type conflicts (weird bug :P).
- Ideally double-check whether project structure is ok, I'd say it could be tidier (components are scattered, e.g. shelf related components could be grouped)
- Refactor Shelf3D slightly to use InstancedMesh, current solution is quicker, but won't perform when you build shelves with large quantities of shelves
